# 📘 Day 01 Documentation

## Project: Banking System (Console-Based, Python)

### 📅 Date

Day 01 (08-09/02/2026) – System Setup (Folder Structure)

### 🎯 Objective for Day 01

The main goal for Day 01 was to initialize and improved the project structure. This serves as the foundation for all future system features.

### 🗂️ Project Folder Structure Overview

The project was structured to follow modular and scalable design principles, making each system feature independent and easy to maintain.

### 🧠 Design Considerations

1. Modular feature-based architecture
2. Clear separation between:

    - Core features
    - Documentation
    - Testing files

3. Folder naming standardized for readability and consistency

### 📝 Notes

No system features were implemented on Day 01.
This phase focused entirely on project organization and preparation for future development.

Daily documentation will be expanded to reflect newly implemented features and system improvements.
