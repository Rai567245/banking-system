# Project Overview

The RGBC ATM Transaction System is a console-based application
designed to simulate real ATM banking operations.

It allows users to securely log in using an account number and PIN,
and perform transactions such as balance inquiry, withdrawal,
deposit, and fund transfer.

The system applies Object-Oriented Programming concepts
to ensure modularity, security, and maintainability.
